# Snake-Game
"I developed a classic Snake game using Python and Turtle graphics, applying principles of object-oriented programming. Leveraging the Turtle module's capabilities, I designed and implemented the game's mechanics, including snake movement, collision detection, and score tracking. By utilizing object-oriented concepts such as classes and inheritance, I created modular, reusable code for easy maintenance and scalability. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming and object-oriented design principles, as well as my ability to develop engaging graphical applications."
